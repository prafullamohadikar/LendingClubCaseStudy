## General Information
The Lending Club Case Study involves a Consumer Finance Company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
The Objective of this case study is to identify risky loan applicants so that loan allotment to such applicants can be avoided leading to lower Credit Loss. This is done using Exploratory Data Analysis.
Benefits of the case study:
    - Gives a fair understanding on how EDA is used in real life business problems.
    - Develops a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services.
    - Creates an understanding of how the data is used to minimize loss of money while lending it to clients.
    - Improves our understating of data visualization and what charts to use for real life data.

- What is the background of your project?
    - This Company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
    - Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.
    - If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
Loan dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
